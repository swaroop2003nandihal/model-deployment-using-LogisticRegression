ðŸ§  Models Used
Logistic Regression (from scikit-learn)
Simple and effective model for binary classification.
Used here to predict eligibility based on categorical and numerical inputs.
The model was trained and saved as model.pkl for deployment.

ðŸ“¥ Input Features
The model takes the following inputs from the user via the Streamlit UI:
Feature	Description	Type	Values
CLMSEX	Gender	Categorical	Male = 1, Female = 0
CLMINSUR	Insurance Detail	Categorical	Yes = 1, No = 0
SEATBELT	Seatbelt Usage	Categorical	Yes = 1, No = 0
CLMAGE	Age	Numerical (Slider)	0 â€“ 100
LOSS	Loss Amount	Numerical	Any float value

ðŸ“¤ Model Outputs
Predicted Class:
Eligible
Not Eligible
Prediction Probabilities:
Probability of class 0
Probability of class 1
Input Summary Table: Shows the exact inputs entered by the user.
