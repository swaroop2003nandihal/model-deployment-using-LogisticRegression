🧠 Models Used
Logistic Regression (from scikit-learn)
Simple and effective model for binary classification.
Used here to predict eligibility based on categorical and numerical inputs.
The model was trained and saved as model.pkl for deployment.

📥 Input Features
The model takes the following inputs from the user via the Streamlit UI:
Feature	Description	Type	Values
CLMSEX	Gender	Categorical	Male = 1, Female = 0
